        <h1>A BLOG POST</h1>
        <p>Typography is one of the most important elements of front end design and development ! in this exercise we'll
            play around with some one the common css properties to manage our style , Let's make a simple blog-post</p>
        <hr>
    </div>
    <div class="content ">
        <p class="info">12.31.2050 <span>| ALL ABOUT CSS BLOG</span></p>
        <h2>ALL ABOUT SIMPLE BLOG</h2>
        <p class="headline"> Headlines, like this one, are great ways to quickly capture the
            reader's attention, to give them a sumary, intro, or other important
            information in a web page. You can use
            text-transform: uppercase; to make a whole body of text
            uppercase using CSS if you really need to grab attention!
        </p>
        <p>
            Okay, now that we're done screaming in the headline in all caps (which you should do sparingly) - it's time
            to chat more about other components of typography. You'll notice that we chose a nice serif font for our
            headings, and a nice sans-serif font for our body text. This is intentional! Serif font faces are generally
            considered pretty inaccessible as a body text style, since at smaller sizes it's much more difficult to
            visually differentiate the characters from one another. At large font sizes, such as those seen in most
            headings, serif fonts are considered fine, since the larger style makes it easier to see where serif
            characters start and where they end.
        </p>
        <p>But wait! What if you want more than just normal text on your page? Another common thing you might see in web
            pages are quotes. To make quotes, we can use the blockquote element and style it accordingly, so it stands
            out a bit as a non-body text quote.

        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote">"This is a quote - you probably knew that at a glance since we gave it some nice
            styling. Pretty nice, huh? A great lesson in User Experience Design, where we take special care to implement
            our web page in a way that makes it pleasant and intuitive for our users/readers. Differentiating our
            different typography components visually makes information much more organized and easier to digest for our
            users."

        <h3>A new Section</h3>
        <p>And just like that, we've got a new section of content separated by a hr element (a 'horizontal rule' or a
            divider) and a new heading. Isn't putting content together fun?

            Notice as well that when we entered in the H3 content, it was all lowercase, but now it's in a nice Title
            Case, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. We did that with CSS! Using text-transform:
            capitalize; we can implement title cased content.

        <h3>Common Font Sizing Approaches</h3>
        <h4><code>px</code>(pixels)</h4>
        <p>Pixels are the simplest way to hard code your font size. By default the browser sets the root font size to
            16px, but you can change the font size in the body element or any other HTML element by setting font-size to
            any number of px.

        </p>
        <h4><code>em</code></h4>
        <p>em units size font relative to the parent element. For example, if the body element is 16px, and a nested div
            element's font size is set to 1.5em, the browser will multiply 16px x 1.5, resulting in 24px font in the
            div.
        </p>
        <h4><code>rem</code>(root em)</h4>
        <p>Root em units are similar to em, but they are relative to the root font size instead of the parent element of
            whatever is being styled. For example, if the root font size (the font size of the body element) is set to
            16px, and we have a p element nested many layers down with a font-size set to 2rem, that paragraph will have
            32px font. If the body font size ever changes, this paragraph will also change accordingly.
        </p>
        <h4>Which one do i use</h4>
        <p>Between em and rem, rem has a nice advantage of all elements being relative to one single root font value,
            where nested elements with parent/child font size dependencies can still be hard to manage with em units.
            When writing responsive styles, rem allows you to simply update the root font size at different screen sizes
            and all elements using rem units will adjust themselves accordingly creating a super easy-to-manage
            typography size system.
        </p>
        <p>In small projects you may not have an issues hard coding pixelage, but it's always important to understand
            the drawbacks of writing styles that may not be responsive or dynamic.
